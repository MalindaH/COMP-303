#Nnowos Contribution
### Implementation (Problem 2)
-worked on the decorator design pattern, implemented the bufferedSongCollection and playcountSongCollection utilizing inheretence to allow playlist to be wrapped in these decorators. I'm not sure who my TA is or how to contact them, but for some reason my commits for the implementation are not clear in the commit history, they are kind of inside other peoples commits. Additionally, for some reason, my commits are either nnowos or xsnow? anyway here is a link to my implementation post https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a4t23/-/issues/4

removed duration from interface and subsequent classes as it was redundant
