#### Implementation (Problem 1)
- Worked with Ben Golding to implement problem 1 using the COMPOSITE Design Pattern
- initial commit for implementations: 
    1. [implemented SongCollection interface](957a03bb8ac4faf588085ea7a14b1c2f1fda2709)
    2. [implemented constructor for Playlist](957a03bb8ac4faf588085ea7a14b1c2f1fda2709)
    3. [added `addUnique()` and `add()` methods](ea104f08e285a0d9bc845d87b43cd920770dd6c4)
    4. [fixed some bugs](e6684e4200a717100410c77c1660490fc7c455bd)

#### Review (Problem 2)

- kept reviewing the implementations of `Song.java`, `Playlist.java` and `Remix.java`, etc, along with feedbacks, discussions or agreements. https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a4t23/-/issues/4#note_22325, https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a4t23/-/issues/4#note_22879
- create new branch and base code setup to help implementations. https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a4t23/-/issues/4#note_22328

#### Test (Problem 3)
- Wrote unit tests related to the clone methods for 3 decorators and Song using both JUnit and various metaprogramming techniques.
- To view my contribution see the following commits: 
    1. [implemented unit tests for playcount/buffer] (b83858db23b872cf39a2ed590acf0577963ebcd3)
    2. [implemented unit tests for remix and part of Song] (c73ca7de434eb635e4a22dd9f31ac9e9a42f851d)

#### Other
- Discussed potential solutions with teammates, and worked colloratively to create solutions.
