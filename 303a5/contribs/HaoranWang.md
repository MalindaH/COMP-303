implementer:
initial implementation for problem 1 and 2 (since they are related)
(create 3 classes that separately extends Song, Album,Playlist) 
However, after it was confirmed that the professor said that our playable object
must have playcount function (instead of optional),all of us agree to  replace
my version of initial implementation problem 1 with  abstract
class that could allow us to stop writing duplicated codes.

somethoughtsaboutproblem3
write everything of problem 3 in class Library(use stack and arraylist to implement
undo/redo(int numberOfTimes))
!2 !3 !6 !7  !20

reviewer:review problem3 and come up with an alternative design 
(implement my version of problem3 so that my teammates could directly compare it
with the previous design)

tester:test problem2
implements HaoranTestProblem2(test count and printedContent)
