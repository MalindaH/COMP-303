### Other
Mostly worked on suring up the feedback from the last submission with this code base: Remade design by contract entirely in the Song and PlayList Classes. Addressed issues with docstrings and precodnitions. Lots of debate went into how we wanted to do design by contract secifically, and this ended up taking a lot of effort.
