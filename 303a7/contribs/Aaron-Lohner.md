### Implementer (area 2)
* Created initial class diagram for planned implementation as seen [here](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a7t21/-/issues/3#note_40515), also described my implementation.
* Implemented all classes indicated in the class diagram above in commits up to and including [this one](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a7t21/-/commit/622e99d0ab11511286c7baddcbcf5b935c4d2c87), and later made updates based on feedback in [this commit](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a7t21/-/commit/7ece8df5e4b46384e48a01c621d84a1366d85db0?merge_request_iid=5). See [this MR](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a7t21/-/merge_requests/5) for more details. Initially coded some implementation for area 1 which was necessary for area 2 implementation.
