Implementation:


- Implented area 1 almost entirely. Conducted design discussions and reviews with @aaron inside the issue i created : Area 1 Implementation [here](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a7t21/-/issues/2)

- Discussed several possibilities and came up with a solution at the end. 


- Made a UML Class Diagram for the reviewer and for general understanding [here](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a7t21/-/issues/2#note_43846)


Review:


- While implementing Area 1 came up with a lot of ideas about how to approach Area 2. My implementation on Area 1 was very closely related to Area 2 and hence was used as it is for all parts of the solution. 


- Gave a lot of suggestions such as : [here](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a7t21/-/merge_requests/5#note_44349)  and [here](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a7t21/-/issues/2#note_43846)


- Made up a Jet UML class diagram to sum up the implementation by my peers : [here](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a7t21/-/merge_requests/5#note_44349)


Tester:

- Wrote a bunch of tests for area 2 and 3 in the branch Area3-tests. These tested the constructor for all classes/types. 

- Tests for equals in each class/type. 

- Tests for accessing food category and dietary categories and checking if these are present or not. 

-  All commits summed up here in the master : [here](037544359917fb14f9ba3db531c0f4fe7a1a123e)


Note: Almost all members agreed and went ahead with my implementation of area 1 which i spent a lot of time on improving and enhancing via insight from my team.
